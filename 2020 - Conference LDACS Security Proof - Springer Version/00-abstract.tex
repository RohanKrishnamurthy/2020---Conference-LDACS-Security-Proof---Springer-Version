Communication is the invisible backbone of the modern air transportation system. Aeronautical data links enable ground crews to communicate with air crews and guide them safely and efficiently to any destination in the world. However, since air traffic is growing rapidly, currently deployed communication systems experience capacity problems and requires modernization. Several new aeronautical data links with different deployment areas shall therefore be introduced. The L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) is foreseen for terrestrial communication in continental air spaces. The implementation of state-of-the-art cybersecurity is an integral part of this modernization and an LDACS security architecture has been developed. However, as of now, its security has not been proven. The contribution of this paper is the formal proof of the security of the Mutual Authentication and Key Exchange (MAKE) protocol of LDACS using the symbolic model checker Tamarin. Our results prove, that the suggested MAKE procedure for LDACS provides the properties of "Executability", "Secure Key Exchange", "Perfect Forward Secrecy" and "Mutual Authentication".
